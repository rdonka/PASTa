# PASTa: Photometry Analysis and Signal Processing Toolbox

Welcome to the documentation site for __PASTa__ (Photometry Analysis and Signal Processing Toolbox)! The PASTa protocol is an open source toolbox and protocol for the preparation, signal processing, and analysis of fiber photometry data. Fiber photometry is a rapidly growing technique to record real-time neural signaling in awake, behaving subjects. However, the processing and analysis of photometry data streams can be complicated, and there is wide divergence in methods across the field. While several opensource signal processing tools exist, platforms can be inflexible in accommodating experimental designs, lack consistency in peak detection, and be difficult for naive users.

The PASTa protocol is developed to be highly flexible and adaptable to a wide variety of experimental designs. While operating through MATLAB, the code is annotated to be readable, accessible, and adaptable for new users. Here you'll find set up instructions, a detailed user guide, example analyses, and additional details on function inputs and usage.
